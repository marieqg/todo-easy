Easy To Do  </h1
</p>


<p>This is a technical test made for training purposes.</p>

## üìè Rules

1. From the data provided in the JSON below you should try to:
   tasks: [
   {id: 1, name: 'Market research', status: 'Completed', progress: 100},
   {id: 2, name: 'Writing specifications', status: 'In Progress', progress: 91},
   {id: 3, name: 'Product design', status: 'In Progress', progress: 67},
   {id: 4, name: 'Development', status: 'In Progress', progress: 42},
   {id: 5, name: 'Tests', status: 'In Progress', progress: 0},
   {id: 6, name: 'Marketing and sales', status: 'To Do', progress: 0}
   ];

2. Create a React component with state variables to store this data
3. Write the function to initialize your component
4. Display the data from the JSON in the form of your choice (an array or a list for example)
5. Style your component a little
6. Create a function that will allow you to sort the data in alphabetical order which will be called when you click on a button that you will have to create
7. Create a function that will filter the tasks according to their status which will be called when clicking on one of the 3 buttons corresponding to the statuses you will have to create (To Do, In Progress, Completed)
8. Create a function that will calculate the average of the progress of the different tasks
